## Hi, I'm Andrea 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer & Architect** with a somewhat unusual background.

I started my career as an accountant, after graduating in Economics. Then, about six years ago, I made a choice: follow my curiosity into the world of data. It wasn't a sudden pivot — it was an evolution, a journey built on study, projects, and a lot of hands-on work.

Today I design and build modern data architectures. I work on **pipelines, lakehouses, streaming** and everything in between raw data and business decisions.

## What I do

My work sits at the intersection of two worlds:

**As a Data Engineer**, I build robust and scalable pipelines. I work with modern stacks — from Spark to Kafka, from cloud to lakehouse architectures — but technology is always a means, never the end.

**As a Data Architect**, I design solutions that make sense for the business, not just for the hype of the moment. My economics background helps: I can speak both to engineers and to decision-makers.

## Why this blog

I write mainly about **emerging technologies in data engineering** — particularly the Rust stack (Polars, RisingWave, Lakekeeper) and modern lakehouse architectures.

This isn't a copy-paste tutorial blog. It's where I explore in depth the technologies that intrigue me and that I believe will have an impact in the coming years.

I write in Italian because there's little quality material on these topics in my language. But I also provide English versions because these technologies deserve a wider audience.
